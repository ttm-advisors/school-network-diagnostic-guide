## School Networking - A Layperson's Guide

It is crucial that 21st century public schools have reliable, stable, low latency computer networks.  The internet has become a primary delivery format for numerous curricula, programs, and learning material across subjects. Much of classroom management, school administration - even attendance tracking - is now done using apps, websites, and platform that depend on near constant access to remote and cloud based server resources. The computer network - both its internal wired and wireless LAN along with its "last-mile" connection to the internet - is essential.

Unfortunately in public schools across the country, including in New York City whose school communities were the impetus for this guide, it's often too often the case that networks are a limiter rather than an academic enabler. Billions of dollars in federal (e.g., erate), state, local, and private donation investment have been spent nationwide and we're still far from where we need to be, especially in our most economically disadvantaged communities.

This guide was written for two related purposes:
* Provide basic "lay person" guide to networking, especially networks in schools, in order to provide some context to the problem and various solutions
* Provide some additional resources, tools, tips, etc. that may be useful to those on the ground in public schools when faced with network challenges.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience for this guide includes:

* Laypeople who may have a personal connection to this topic. This may include parents and may also include members of the general public who see the need for better networks and would like to better understand the problem and potential remediations
* School staff including teachers, tech coordinators, principals, etc. who could benefit from more context and additional training material
* Philanthropists who are interested in how they might be able financial support improvement to computer networks.
