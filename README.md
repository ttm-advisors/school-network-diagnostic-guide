## School Networking - A Layperson's Guide

Few could deny how important it is that 21st century public schools have reliable, stable, low latency computer networks.  The internet has become a primary delivery format for numerous curricula, programs, and learning material across subjects. Much of classroom management, school administration - even attendance tracking - is now done using apps, websites, and platform that depend on near constant access to remote and cloud based server resources. The computer network - its internal wired and wireless LAN along with its "last-mile" connection to internet - is essential

Unfortunately in public schools across the country, including in New York City, whose school communities were the impetus for this guide, it's often the case that networks are a limiter rather than an academic enabler. Billions of dollars in investment have been spent nationwide and we're still far from where we need to be.

This guide is written as a starting point to address these challenges, if not at a systemic level at least at the level of the individual school.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience for this guide includes:

* Laypeople who may have a personal connection to this topic. This may include parents and may also include members of the general public who see the need for better networks and would like to better understand the problem and potential remediations
* School staff including teachers, tech coordinators, principals, etc. who could benefit from more context and additional training material
* Philanthropists who are interested in how they might be able financial support improvement to computer networks.
