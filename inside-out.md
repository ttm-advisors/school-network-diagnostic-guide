# Inside Out Model

One approach to diagnosing network bottlenecks and problems is to go inside-out, from the original device encountering a network issues, then up and out to broader areas of the network:

1. The Device

2. The Device's Network Card ("NIC Card")

3. Nearby Wireless Access Points

4. Building Construction  

5. Building Wiring / Internal Wired LAN

6. Proxy Server and Filter

7. "Last Mile" / ISP

8. Internet and Destination/Remote Services
