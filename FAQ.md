### Where does bandwidth for schools come from and is there enough to go around?
New York City, given its prominent global stature, is generously supplied with bandwidth to the city. Internet bandwidth comes through the physical lines, owned by large global telecoms, that pass under the Hudson and East Rivers. These telecoms in turn sell internet access to homes and businesses. Some telecoms also choose to resell/wholesale bandwidth to smaller internet service providers who work directly with home and business end users.

The NYC Department of Education is comprised of approximately 1,300 school buildings. The internet traffic for devices of the administrators, teachers, and students working and studying in these 1,300 buildings is routed, like a funnel, through one of these private internet service providers. The DOE recently completed a [bid process](https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/RequestDetail/20170614013) for a new internet service provider to increase total capacity from 24Gpbs to 240Gbps, a 10x increase. Lightower won the contract and is in the process of doing its upgrade.

### How does it get to a school building
The problem with internet access to schools really starts with getting enough bandwidth into the school building itself. There are two steps involved:

* First internet traffic travels from Lightower's internet service into large capacity fiber optic wires, leased by, and private to, the DOE, that create a "ring" across the city that connect seven Department of Education "nodes" -- meeting points of network connections much like the the joints that might connect different water pipes in a plumbing system.

* Second, schools are connected to whichever of these seven nodes is geographically closest to their building via a wired connection, called a circuit, provided by either Verizon or Lightower. The speed of this connect may ranges from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. This connection from the school building to the closet DOE "node" is sometimes referred to as the "last mile problem". The DOE has another project underway to upgrade all circuits in the city to 100Mpbs for single school campuses, 150 Mbps for shared campuses.

Together, this ring and the individual circuits used to connect schools to the ring, are sometimes referred to as the DOE's "WAN" (Wide Area Network)

### Why are wired connections used to connect schools?
Given the concentration of buildings and obstructions in New York City coupled with the bandwidth requirements wireless technologies are not yet practical or price appropriate for connecting schools to the DOE within the city, despite the recent evolution in high bandwidth wireless technologies. An exciting development, is mesh networking, which uses low power, short distance wireless connectivity. For the foreseeable future though last mile wired connections will be the norm.


### How much does "last-mile" bandwidth the school building need?

If you have only enough water to run your sink but not your sink and your toilet, you don’t have enough water coming into the house. The same holds true for bandwidth to the internet - just as there needs to be enough water pressure for each toilet and shower, there need to be enough internet - enough "bandwidth" - to serve everyone who wants to use it in a school building.

Bandwidth is a measure of internet speed -- the amount of information or data that can come to a computer from the internet \(download speed\) and from a computer back to the internet \(upload speed\).  

How much band with is needed in a school? A common refrain is that all schools need "high speed internet" or "broadband". [Until 2015 the FCC definition on "high speed" was 4Mbps](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/faster-internet-fcc-sets-new-definition-broadband-speeds-n296276) when the [FCC definition was upgraded to 25Mbps](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/broadband-speed-guide). Mbps stands for Million Bits per Second - "Bits" are individual 1s and 0s that all is the base of all digital commmunication. The FCC also provides some guidelines for how much bandwidth is required for various common internet uses, including
* "General Browsing and Email - 1 Mbps"
* "File Downloading - 10Mbps"
* "Streaming Standard Definition Video - 3-4 Mbps"

As context before 2007 the NYC DOE used an onlder



Way back when the Government said a student needed 10 of something; now it says a student needs 100 of the same thing; but everyone knows that the answer is it depends.  In the water example, if everyone in your house is taking a shower, there isn’t likely to be enough water to go around.  Or to use a more graphic example, suppose that the internet is like a big sewer.  If everyone in a house flushes the toilet at the same time the sewer might fill up to fast and overflow, causing back ups.

### How do you get the internet in the school building to the students who want to use it?

Assume you have enough internet to the building \(the last mile\), and you have enough internet coming inside the building \(band with\), but how do you get it to the students who are spread out in different places in the building?    It’s like you have only one sink or shower in your house, or worse yet only one toilet.  If everyone has to “go” at the same time, well you get the idea.  In internet language this problem is solved by  “routing” the internet either by wires in the building or through the air which is called “Wi Fi”.  School buildings which are older \(most\) have old wiring that is likely to be too old to carry enough power, and is unlikely to go where the students now use the internet.  It may go to one classroom only.  It may be so thin and old that it only allows a small amount of internet to go through it.  In the water analogy there may be  leaky pipes in the kitchen and bathroom, so just sending more “band with” into a school or to a classroom may not help.  The internet, like the water in the pipes, is leaking out before it gets to the place the student needs it.  In any event, at some point  it lands somewhere in the building and it is connected by wire or “wi Fi” to a “router”, which often looks like a small saucer on the wall or the ceiling.

### New York City has never really figured out how to do it right
(Note to P.S.: Which specific projects, in 2007 and in 2017, does this refer?)

In 2007 New York City began installing cables, connections and other things required to provide high speed internet to school buildings.  It spent a lot of money, \(over $300 million\) and by one account it did not put adequate controls and oversight in place to ensure that the system-wide upgrade was done properly or within budget.  Surveys done by various people show there are serious limitations on the availability of high speed internet in schools, particularly in areas of underserved students.

In June 2017 New York City asked that companies bid on the right to upgrade the system and has $750 million allocated in a master plan to do so by 2020.  Experts point out that there are serious questions about how the money will be spent and whether by the time the planned upgrades are done they will be adequate.  An [city audit report from 2017](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/SI16_082A.pdf) reports that

### So what is the problem in any one school building?

This is the multi-facetted, really complicated question.  The answer is maybe problem 2 \(it does not get the last mile\), problem 3, \(it does not get into the building with enough power for all the students\), problem 4 \(it does not get to where the students need it with enough power for all the students in the class\) OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS.
