## Frequently Asked Questions
### Where does the bandwidth come from and is there enough to go around?

New York City has lots of internet to go around in generally. The DOE presently is in the process of upgrading from 24 Gpbs to 240 Gpbs - this is for the entire DOE. This is likely an upgrade that will soon enough be too little.

###  How does it get to a school building?

The problem with access for schools starts with getting enough of it into the school building.  Generally network connectivity to schools must be wired? \(satellites and other wireless high bandwidth technologies are generally not a good option – NYC has too many buildings and obstructions to make transmission other than by wires possible for these purposes; mesh networks though are worth watching\). This is the “last mile problem”. Connectivity from the DOE network to school buildings ranges from 10Mbps to 100Mbps via a dedicated ciruit provided by either Verizon or Lighttower.

### How much does the school  building need?

If you have only enough water to run your sink but not your sink and your toilet, you don’t have enough water coming into the house  The same with the internet.  It has to come that last mile with enough “vroom” \(like water pressure\) to serve everyone who wants to use it in a school building.  They call this “band with”, which is the amount of information or data that can come to a computer from the internet \(download speed\) and from a computer back to the internet \(upload speed\).  How much band with is needed in a school?  Way back when the Government said a student needed 10 of something; now it says a student needs 100 of the same thing; but everyone knows that the answer is it depends.  In the water example, if everyone in your house is taking a shower, there isn’t likely to be enough water to go around.  Or to use a more graphic example, suppose that the internet is like a big sewer.  If everyone in a house flushes the toilet at the same time the sewer might fill up to fast and overflow, causing back ups.

### How do you get the internet in the school building to the students who want to use it?

Assume you have enough internet to the building \(the last mile\), and you have enough internet coming inside the building \(band with\), but how do you get it to the students who are spread out in different places in the building?    It’s like you have only one sink or shower in your house, or worse yet only one toilet.  If everyone has to “go” at the same time, well you get the idea.  In internet language this problem is solved by  “routing” the internet either by wires in the building or through the air which is called “Wi Fi”.  School buildings which are older \(most\) have old wiring that is likely to be too old to carry enough power, and is unlikely to go where the students now use the internet.  It may go to one classroom only.  It may be so thin and old that it only allows a small amount of internet to go through it.  In the water analogy there may be  leaky pipes in the kitchen and bathroom, so just sending more “band with” into a school or to a classroom may not help.  The internet, like the water in the pipes, is leaking out before it gets to the place the student needs it.  In any event, at some point  it lands somewhere in the building and it is connected by wire or “wi Fi” to a “router”, which often looks like a small saucer on the wall or the ceiling.

### New York City has never really figured out how to do it right

In 2007 New York City began installing cables, connections and other things required to provide high speed internet to school buildings.  It spent a lot of money, \(over $300 million\) and by one account it did not put adequate controls and oversight in place to ensure that the system-wide upgrade was done properly or within budget.  Surveys done by various people show there are serious limitations on the availability of high speed internet in schools, particularly in areas of underserved students.    In June, 2017 New York  City asked  that companies bid on the right to upgrade the system and has $750 million allocated in a master plan to do so by 2020.  Experts point out that there are serious questions about how the money will be spent and whether by the time the planned upgrades are done they will be adequate.

### So what is the problem in any one school building?

Now your asking a really complicated question.  The answer is maybe problem 2 \(it does not get the last mile\), problem 3, \(it does not get into the building with enough power for all the students\), problem 4 \(it does not get to where the students need it with enough power for all the students in the class\) OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS.
