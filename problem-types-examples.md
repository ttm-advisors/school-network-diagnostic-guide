## Network Problems
There are many different problems associated with a school's network that can result in students, teachers, and administrators unable to use the network altogether, experiencing slow performance, or finding themselves prevented from using certain websites or apps.

### Approach
When diagnosing a network problem, it's important to apply a bit of the scientific process, including the rule to only change one thing (variable) at time when conducting experiments to unearth potential issues.

It's also important when diagnosing networks to use a logical model that guides a step-by-step approach. Two such models, which may be used together, are the ["bottoms-up"](bottoms-up.md) and ["inside-out"](inside-out.md) models, which can be used in tandem. "Bottoms-up" refers to the process from starting at the physical layer ("Is the computer plugged in?", "Is the network cable connected?") up through various technical layers to user's application. "Inside out" is used to scope a problem with the network by looking first at the device on which network problems are manifesting, then to the immediate local network (WAPs, cabling nearby) to the building's overall network, and then out to a wider network and the internet itself.

## Common problems
### Insufficient last-mile bandwidth
* Symptoms
	* To users of ALL the devices in the school, both wired and wireless devices, it will feel like the network is "sluggish". Connections with time out. Videos will buffer.
* Timing
	* Chronic or, at least, large chunks of the school day.

### Too many devices on the network
* Symptoms
	* Similar to insufficient last-mile bandwidth -- slowness and time outs
* Timing
	* Shorter bursts of time, maybe for an hour during lunch

### Underpowered and overused WAPs
* Symptoms
	* Most to all of users of devices in a single location (like a classroom) are experiencing latency and time outs, but other users in the building are not having similar problems.

### WAPs too far from end users
* Symptoms
	* A user or two see very slow performance of the network, and frequent time out
