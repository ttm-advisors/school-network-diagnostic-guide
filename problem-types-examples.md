## Network Problems
There are many different problems associated with a school's network that can result in students, teachers, and administrators unable to use the network altogether, experiencing slow performance, or finding themselves prevented from using certain websites or apps.

### Approach
When diagnosing a network problem, it's important to apply a bit of the scientific process, including the rule to only change one thing (variable) at time when conducting experiments to unearth potential issues.

It's also important when diagnosing networks to use a logical model that guides a step-by-step approach. Two such models, which may be used together, are the ["bottoms-up"](bottoms-up.md) and ["inside-out"](inside-out.md) models, which can be used in tandem. "Bottoms-up" refers to the process from starting at the physical layer ("Is the computer plugged in?", "Is the network cable connected?") up through various technical layers to user's application. "Inside out" is used to scope a problem with the network by looking first at the device on which network problems are manifesting, then to the immediate local network (WAPs, cabling nearby) to the building's overall network, and then out to a wider network and the internet itself. 

## Symptoms and Implications at Schools

* A single or small group of laptops in the class can not connect to a network
	* Potential causes
		* Cause 1
		* Cause 2
